 # What is a Doubly Linked List?
     A doubly linked list is a data structure that consists of a set of nodes, each of which contains a value and two pointers, one pointing to the previous node in the list and one pointing to the next node in the list. This allows for efficient traversal of the list in both directions, making it suitable for applications where frequent insertions and deletions are required.
