# O(n) The more the items the more the time it takes to execute; linear.

* O(1) constant time, the execution time of an algorithm remains constant regardless of the input size. Example if items have known locations.

* O(n^2) The algorithms execution time grows quadratically with the size of the input data (represented by n). Example, Imagine you have two boxes of items and want to compare each item with every other item to find specific pairs. As the number of items (n) increases, the number of comparisons(n^2) grows much faster.

* O(log n) Time complexity refers to an algorithm's runtime that grows logarithimically with the size of the input (represented by n). In simpler terms, as the input size increases, the time it takes for the algorithm to run increases slowly.
